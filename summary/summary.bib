	abstract = {The study of systems with sustained energy uptake and dissipation at the scale of the constituent particles is an area of central interest in nonequilibrium statistical physics. Identifying such systems as a distinct category—Active matter—unifies our understanding of autonomous collective movement in the living world and in some surprising inanimate imitations. In this article I present the active matter framework, briefly recall some early work, review our recent results on single-particle and collective behaviour, including experiments on active granular monolayers, and discuss new directions for the future.},

	abstract = {The term active matter describes diverse systems, spanning macroscopic (e.g., shoals of fish and flocks of birds) to microscopic scales (e.g., migrating cells, motile bacteria and gels formed through the interaction of nanoscale molecular motors with cytoskeletal filaments within cells). Such systems are often idealizable in terms of collections of individual units, referred to as active particles or self-propelled particles, which take energy from an internal replenishable energy depot or ambient medium and transduce it into useful work performed on the environment, in addition to dissipating a fraction of this energy into heat. These individual units may interact both directly and through disturbances propagated via the medium in which they are immersed. Active particles can exhibit remarkable collective behavior as a consequence of these interactions, including non-equilibrium phase transitions between novel dynamical phases, large fluctuations violating expectations from the central limit theorem and substantial robustness against the disordering effects of thermal fluctuations. In this chapter, following a brief summary of experimental systems, which may be classified as examples of active matter, I describe some of the principles which underlie the modelling of such systems.},

	abstract = {Driven by the necessity to achieve a thorough comprehension of the bottom-up fabrication process of functional materials, this experimental study investigates the pairwise interactions or collisions between chemically active {SiO}2–Pt Janus colloids. These collisions are categorized based on the Janus colloids’ orientations before and after they make physical contact. In addition to the hydrodynamic interactions, the Janus colloids are also known to affect each other’s chemical field, resulting in chemophoretic interactions, which depend on the degree of surface anisotropy in reactivity of Janus colloid and the solute–surface interaction at play. Our study reveals that these interactions lead to a noticeable decrease in particle speed and changes in orientation that correlate with the contact duration and yield different collision types. Distinct configurations of contact during collisions were found, whose mechanisms and likelihood are found to be dependent primarily on the chemical interactions. Such estimates of collision and their characterization in dilute suspensions shall have a key impact in determining the arrangement and time scales of dynamical structures and assemblies of denser suspensions and potentially the functional materials of the future.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive computational study of the collective behavior emerging from the competition between self-propulsion, excluded volume interactions and velocity-alignment in a two-dimensional model of active particles. We consider an extension of the active brownian particles model where the self-propulsion direction of the particles aligns with the one of their neighbors. We analyze the onset of collective motion (flocking) in a low-density regime (10\% surface area) and show that it is mainly controlled by the strength of velocity-alignment interactions: the competition between self-propulsion and crowding effects plays a minor role in the emergence of flocking. However, above the flocking threshold, the system presents a richer pattern formation scenario than analogous models without alignment interactions (active brownian particles) or excluded volume effects (Vicsek-like models). Depending on the parameter regime, the structure of the system is characterized by either a broad distribution of finite-sized polar clusters or the presence of an amorphous, highly fluctuating, large-scale traveling structure which can take a lane-like or band-like form (and usually a hybrid structure which is halfway in between both). We establish a phase diagram that summarizes collective behavior of polar active brownian particles and propose a generic mechanism to describe the complexity of the large-scale structures observed in systems of repulsive self-propelled particles.},

	abstract = {Active matter spans a wide range of time and length scales, from groups of cells and synthetic self-propelled colloids to schools of fish and flocks of birds. The theoretical framework describing these systems has shown tremendous success in finding universal phenomenology. However, further progress is often burdened by the difficulty of determining forces controlling the dynamics of individual elements within each system. Accessing this local information is pivotal for the understanding of the physics governing an ensemble of active particles and for the creation of numerical models capable of explaining the observed collective phenomena. In this work, we present {ActiveNet}, a machine-learning tool consisting of a graph neural network that uses the collective motion of particles to learn active and two-body forces controlling their individual dynamics. We verify our approach using numerical simulations of active Brownian particles, active particles undergoing underdamped Langevin dynamics, and chiral active Brownian particles considering different interaction potentials and values of activity. Interestingly, {ActiveNet} can equally learn conservative or nonconservative forces as well as torques. Moreover, {ActiveNet} has proven to be a useful tool to learn the stochastic contribution to the forces, enabling the estimation of the diffusion coefficients. Therefore, all coefficients of the equation of motion of Active Brownian Particles are captured. Finally, we apply {ActiveNet} to experiments of electrophoretic Janus particles, extracting the active and two-body forces controlling colloids' dynamics. On the one side, we have learned that the active force depends on the electric field and area fraction. On the other side, we have also discovered a dependence of the two-body interaction with the electric field that leads us to propose that the dominant force between active colloids is a screened electrostatic interaction with a constant length scale. We believe that the proposed methodological tool, {ActiveNet}, might open a new avenue for the study and modeling of experimental suspensions of active particles.},
