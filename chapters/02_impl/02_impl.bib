	abstract = {Active particles are microscopic particles capable to propel themselves, such as bacteria, chemotactic cells, organelles within the cells, and self-phoretic colloids. For their very nature, they belong to the class of non-equilibrium phenomena. They play a significant role as a model system in our understanding of the dynamics of out-of-equilibrium systems, especially those involving living organisms at the microscale. Furthermore, the interest in these active particles is also fueled by their potential for applications as autonomous agents for health care, sustainability, and security applications.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive computational study of the collective behavior emerging from the competition between self-propulsion, excluded volume interactions and velocity-alignment in a two-dimensional model of active particles. We consider an extension of the active brownian particles model where the self-propulsion direction of the particles aligns with the one of their neighbors. We analyze the onset of collective motion (flocking) in a low-density regime (10\% surface area) and show that it is mainly controlled by the strength of velocity-alignment interactions: the competition between self-propulsion and crowding effects plays a minor role in the emergence of flocking. However, above the flocking threshold, the system presents a richer pattern formation scenario than analogous models without alignment interactions (active brownian particles) or excluded volume effects (Vicsek-like models). Depending on the parameter regime, the structure of the system is characterized by either a broad distribution of finite-sized polar clusters or the presence of an amorphous, highly fluctuating, large-scale traveling structure which can take a lane-like or band-like form (and usually a hybrid structure which is halfway in between both). We establish a phase diagram that summarizes collective behavior of polar active brownian particles and propose a generic mechanism to describe the complexity of the large-scale structures observed in systems of repulsive self-propelled particles.},
