	abstract = {Active particles are microscopic particles capable to propel themselves, such as bacteria, chemotactic cells, organelles within the cells, and self-phoretic colloids. For their very nature, they belong to the class of non-equilibrium phenomena. They play a significant role as a model system in our understanding of the dynamics of out-of-equilibrium systems, especially those involving living organisms at the microscale. Furthermore, the interest in these active particles is also fueled by their potential for applications as autonomous agents for health care, sustainability, and security applications.},
