	abstract = {Self-propelled particles include both self-phoretic synthetic colloids and various microorganisms. By continually consuming energy, they bypass the laws of equilibrium thermodynamics. These laws enforce the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium: The steady state is then independent of kinetic parameters. In contrast, self-propelled particles tend to accumulate where they move more slowly. They may also slow down at high density for either biochemical or steric reasons. This creates positive feedback, which can lead to motility-induced phase separation ({MIPS}) between dense and dilute fluid phases. At leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variable-speed, self-propelled particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations but generally breaks down at higher order in gradients: New effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing field of {MIPS}, focusing on theory and simulation but including a brief speculative survey of its experimental implications.},

The precise ways in which these motile microbes behave in their confined environment remain unclear. Using experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations, we study the motility of a single Chlamydomonas microalga in an isolated microhabitat with controlled geometric properties. We demonstrate how the geometry of the habitat controls the cell’s navigation in confinement. The probability of finding the cell swimming near the boundary increases with the wall curvature, as seen for both circular and elliptical chambers. The theory, utilizing an asymmetric dumbbell model of the cell and steric wall interactions, captures this curvature-guided navigation quantitatively with no free parameters.},

	abstract = {We present a stochastic description of a model of N mutually interacting active particles in the presence of external fields and characterize its steady state behavior in the absence of currents. To reproduce the effects of the experimentally observed persistence of the trajectories of the active particles we consider a Gaussian force having a non-vanishing correlation time τ, whose finiteness is a measure of the activity of the system. With these ingredients we show that it is possible to develop a statistical mechanical approach similar to the one employed in the study of equilibrium liquids and to obtain the explicit form of the many-particle distribution function by means of the multidimensional unified colored noise approximation. Such a distribution plays a role analogous to the Gibbs distribution in equilibrium statistical mechanics and provides complete information about the microscopic state of the system. From here we develop a method to determine the one- and two-particle distribution functions in the spirit of the Born–Green–Yvon ({BGY}) equations of equilibrium statistical mechanics. The resulting equations which contain extra-correlations induced by the activity allow us to determine the stationary density profiles in the presence of external fields, the pair correlations and the pressure of active fluids. In the low density regime we obtained the effective pair potential ϕ(r) acting between two isolated particles separated by a distance, r, showing the existence of an effective attraction between them induced by activity. Based on these results, in the second half of the paper we propose a mean field theory as an approach simpler than the {BGY} hierarchy and use it to derive a van der Waals expression of the equation of state.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive computational study of the collective behavior emerging from the competition between self-propulsion, excluded volume interactions and velocity-alignment in a two-dimensional model of active particles. We consider an extension of the active brownian particles model where the self-propulsion direction of the particles aligns with the one of their neighbors. We analyze the onset of collective motion (flocking) in a low-density regime (10\% surface area) and show that it is mainly controlled by the strength of velocity-alignment interactions: the competition between self-propulsion and crowding effects plays a minor role in the emergence of flocking. However, above the flocking threshold, the system presents a richer pattern formation scenario than analogous models without alignment interactions (active brownian particles) or excluded volume effects (Vicsek-like models). Depending on the parameter regime, the structure of the system is characterized by either a broad distribution of finite-sized polar clusters or the presence of an amorphous, highly fluctuating, large-scale traveling structure which can take a lane-like or band-like form (and usually a hybrid structure which is halfway in between both). We establish a phase diagram that summarizes collective behavior of polar active brownian particles and propose a generic mechanism to describe the complexity of the large-scale structures observed in systems of repulsive self-propelled particles.},

	abstract = {Animal groups represent magnificent archetypes of self-organized collective behavior. As such, they have attracted enormous interdisciplinary interest in the last years. From a mechanistic point of view, animal aggregations remind physical systems of particles or spins, where the individual constituents interact locally, giving rise to ordering at the global scale. This analogy has fostered important research, where numerical and theoretical approaches from physics have been applied to models of self-organized motion. In this paper, we discuss how the physics methodology may provide precious conceptual and technical instruments in empirical studies of collective animal behavior. We focus on three-dimensional groups, for which empirical data have been extremely scarce until recently, and describe novel experimental protocols that allow reconstructing aggregations of thousands of individuals. We show how an appropriate statistical analysis of these large-scale data allows inferring important information on the interactions between individuals in a group, a key issue in behavioral studies and a basic ingredient of theoretical models. To this aim, we revisit the approach we recently used on starling flocks, and apply it to a much larger data set, never analyzed before. The results confirm our previous findings and indicate that interactions between birds have a topological rather than metric nature, each individual interacting with a fixed number of neighbors irrespective of their distances.},

	abstract = {Numerical models indicate that collective animal behavior may emerge from simple local rules of interaction among the individuals. However, very little is known about the nature of such interaction, so that models and theories mostly rely on aprioristic assumptions. By reconstructing the three-dimensional positions of individual birds in airborne flocks of a few thousand members, we show that the interaction does not depend on the metric distance, as most current models and theories assume, but rather on the topological distance. In fact, we discovered that each bird interacts on average with a fixed number of neighbors (six to seven), rather than with all neighbors within a fixed metric distance. We argue that a topological interaction is indispensable to maintain a flock's cohesion against the large density changes caused by external perturbations, typically predation. We support this hypothesis by numerical simulations, showing that a topological interaction grants significantly higher cohesion of the aggregation compared with a standard metric one.},

	abstract = {Systems comprised of self-steering active Brownian particles are studied via simulations for a minimal cognitive flocking model. The dynamics of the active Brownian particles is extended by an orientational response with limited maneuverability to an instantaneous visual input of the positions of neighbors within a vision cone and a cut-off radius. The system exhibits large-scale self-organized structures, which depend on selected parameter values, and, in particular, the presence of excluded-volume interactions. The emergent structures in two dimensions, such as worms, worm-aggregate coexistence, and hexagonally close-packed structures, are analysed and phase diagrams are constructed. The analysis of the particle's mean-square displacement shows {ABP}-like dynamics for dilute systems and the worm phase. In the limit of densely packed structures, the active diffusion coefficient is significantly smaller and depends on the number of particles in the cluster. Our analysis of the cluster-growth dynamics shows distinct differences to processes in systems of short-range attractive colloids in equilibrium. Specifically, the characteristic time for the growth and decay of clusters of a particular size is longer than that of isotropically attractive colloids, which we attribute to the non-reciprocal nature of the directed visual perception. Our simulations reveal a strong interplay between {ABP}-characteristic interactions, such as volume exclusion and rotational diffusion, and cognitive-based interactions and navigation.},

These collisions are categorized based on the Janus colloids’ orientations before and after they make physical contact. In addition to the hydrodynamic interactions, the Janus colloids are also known to affect each other’s chemical field, resulting in chemophoretic interactions, which depend on the degree of surface anisotropy in reactivity of Janus colloid and the solute–surface interaction at play. Our study reveals that these interactions lead to a noticeable decrease in particle speed and changes in orientation that correlate with the contact duration and yield different collision types. Distinct configurations of contact during collisions were found, whose mechanisms and likelihood are found to be dependent primarily on the chemical interactions. Such estimates of collision and their characterization in dilute suspensions shall have a key impact in determining the arrangement and time scales of dynamical structures and assemblies of denser suspensions and potentially the functional materials of the future.},
